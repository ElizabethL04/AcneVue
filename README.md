# AcneVue

## Inspiration
AcneVue was born out of a collective commitment to revolutionize skincare. We were inspired by the challenges of acne, so we created a sophisticated image detection model. 
## What it does
Our app precisely identifies whiteheads, blackheads, papules, pustules, and cysts, providing users with tailored skincare insights. 
## How we built it
To create and train our custom ML model, we used TensorFlow and Keras. The frameworks we used were React for the front end and Flask for the back end. 
## Challenges we ran into
We encountered issues with parsing a JSON file with React since TensorFlow Lite and React are not very compatible. To combat this issue, we used Flask for the backend.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to train our first-ever ML model with _**60% accuracy**_.
Users can upload or use a webcam to scan their skin with our ML model.
## What we learned
We learned about how to train ML models using TensorFlow and how to use Flask. 
## What's next for Acne-Vue
In the future, we hope to create personalized skincare regimes based on their acne issues, acne severity and skin type. We also hope to improve the user experience of our application by making it compatible with mobile devices.
